Our **Wall Injection System** targets hidden infestations deep inside wall voids, cracks, and structural cavities—areas that traditional surface treatments can’t always reach. This method is especially effective for termites, ants, and other insects that travel through tight, concealed spaces.

With minimal disruption to your property, we inject precision-applied solutions where pests are nesting—right inside the walls.

## 🧰 How It Works

1. **Assessment & Mapping**  
   We assess your wall structure and infestation signs to locate high-risk zones and plan injection points.

2. **Precision Drilling**  
   Small access holes are carefully drilled in inconspicuous spots to reach the interior voids of the wall.

3. **Direct Chemical Injection**  
   Long-lasting termiticides or pest control agents are injected straight into wall cavities for maximum effectiveness.

4. **Sealing & Restoration**  
   After treatment, holes are sealed and blended back into the surface—leaving no visible trace.
