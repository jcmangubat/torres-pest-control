**T**ermites don’t rest—and neither should your protection. The **Exterra Termite Baiting System** is a science-backed, eco-sensitive approach to wiping out entire termite colonies without invasive drilling or harsh chemicals.

Instead of spraying your soil or walls, this method **lures termites in**, feeds them a toxic-free bait, and lets them take it **straight back to the queen**.

## 🐜 What Is the Exterra Baiting System?

Exterra is a premium, in-ground and above-ground termite baiting system used worldwide to control subterranean termite colonies. It’s discreet, low-maintenance, and highly effective for long-term termite protection.

This system uses:

- Smart monitoring stations strategically placed around your home
- A palatable, slow-acting bait termites prefer over wood
- A **transfer effect**—termites feed, return, and spread it through the colony

---

## ✅ Why Choose Baiting Over Spraying?

Unlike traditional methods that try to block or kill on contact, **baiting works with termite behavior**—not against it.

**Benefits include:**

- 🎯 Targets the entire colony, including the queen
- 🧘 Less invasive—no drilling or soil disruption
- 🍃 Eco-friendly and family-safe
- 🔄 Continuous monitoring and proactive protection
- 🔍 Early detection—even before damage is visible

---

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Inspection & Setup**  
   Our specialists assess your property and install bait stations at key points—usually every 3 meters.

2. **Monitoring & Detection**  
   Termites discover the bait and begin feeding. We monitor their activity and replenish the bait as needed.

3. **Colony Elimination**  
   Over time, bait spreads throughout the colony. Termites die gradually, ensuring they don’t suspect or avoid it.

4. **Ongoing Protection**  
   Even after the colony is gone, the system remains in place for ongoing monitoring and prevention.
