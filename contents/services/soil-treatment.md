Soil treatment is one of the most effective long-term solutions to prevent termite infestations—especially for new constructions and buildings in termite-prone areas. It creates a treated barrier beneath and around your structure to stop termites before they ever make contact with your property.

## 🧪 What is Soil Treatment?

Soil treatment involves applying a specialized termiticide solution to the soil under and around your foundation. It acts as a chemical shield that repels or eliminates termites trying to reach your home.

This proactive method is ideal for:

- New home or commercial builds  
- Renovation projects  
- Areas with a history of termite activity  
- Post-construction treatments (in some cases)

## 🚧 When is Soil Treatment Done?

We offer both **Pre-Construction** and **Post-Construction** soil treatments:

### 🏗 Pre-Construction  
- Applied before pouring the foundation  
- Treated at key stages (e.g., trenching, compaction, backfilling)  
- Cost-effective and long-lasting defense

### 🏠 Post-Construction  
- Applied by drilling holes along the perimeter of the foundation  
- Termiticide is injected into the soil  
- Restores protection for older buildings
