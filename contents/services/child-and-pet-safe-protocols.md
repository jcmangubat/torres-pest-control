At Torres Pest Control, we know your home isn't just a place—it's where your kids play, your pets roam, and your family grows. That’s why our **Child and Pet Safe Protocols** are thoughtfully designed to keep your loved ones protected while effectively eliminating pests.

We use carefully selected, low-toxicity products and implement barrier methods that minimize contact with treated surfaces. Your family's health and safety is always our top priority.

## 🛡️ How We Keep Kids and Pets Safe

- Use of low-impact, non-toxic pest control agents

- Physical barriers and targeted spot treatments (no wide spray zones)

We go beyond just saying it's “safe”—we make sure you understand exactly how and why it is.
