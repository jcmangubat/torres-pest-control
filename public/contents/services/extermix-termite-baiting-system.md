**T**ermites can silently destroy a home or building from the inside out. With the **Extermix Termite Baiting System**, we take a smarter and safer approach to termite control. Instead of flooding your property with chemicals, this method uses scientifically designed bait stations to target and eliminate termite colonies at the source.

## What is Extermix?

Extermix is a termite management system that uses strategically placed bait stations around your property. These stations contain an active ingredient that termites find more appealing than wood. Once ingested, the bait is brought back to the colony, affecting the entire termite population over time.

This system is designed for long-term termite suppression and prevention, and it is especially ideal for sensitive environments like homes, schools, hospitals, and commercial spaces.

## Why Choose Extermix?

- **Non-invasive**: No need for drilling, trenching, or heavy treatments.
- **Eco-conscious**: Targets termites without harming pets, plants, or the surrounding environment.
- **Continuous monitoring**: Bait stations are checked regularly to ensure ongoing protection.
- **Colony elimination**: Unlike traditional spot treatments, baiting systems work to eliminate the entire termite colony.
- **Peace of mind**: Trusted by pest control professionals in the Philippines for long-term success.

## Our Process

1. **Inspection** – We assess your property to identify termite activity and areas at risk.
2. **Installation** – Bait stations are placed discreetly around the perimeter of your property.
3. **Monitoring** – Regular visits ensure bait consumption is tracked and stations are replenished if needed.
4. **Colony Control** – As termites share the bait, the colony gradually weakens and is eliminated.
5. **Ongoing Support** – Even after the termites are gone, we continue monitoring to prevent reinfestation.

## Ideal For:

- Residential homes
- Offices and commercial buildings
- Warehouses
- Schools and healthcare facilities

> **Did you know?** Termites never sleep! They eat and work 24/7, which is why early detection and continuous monitoring—like what Extermix offers—are key to effective protection.
