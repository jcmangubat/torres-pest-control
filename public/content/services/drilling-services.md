**W**hen termites have already made their way into hard-to-reach areas—beneath tiles, concrete, or foundations—ordinary treatment methods won’t be enough. That’s where **drilling services** come in. Our team uses precision drilling techniques to create access points, allowing termite treatment solutions to reach deep into hidden zones where colonies often nest.

## Why Is Drilling Necessary?

Termites are silent invaders that often build their colonies underneath or inside structures. By the time they’re visible, damage may already be significant. Drilling helps us:

- **Reach subterranean colonies** directly beneath floors or slabs
- **Inject termiticides** into voids, gaps, and soil under concrete
- **Treat areas inaccessible by surface spraying**
- **Reinforce protective barriers** during or after termite infestations

## Our Drilling Process

1. **Assessment** – We evaluate the affected area to determine where and how drilling should be done.
2. **Precision Drilling** – Using professional-grade equipment, we drill small, clean holes with minimal disruption to your property.
3. **Termiticide Injection** – Through these holes, we inject highly effective anti-termite solutions that soak the soil or internal gaps where termites reside.
4. **Sealing & Restoration** – Once treatment is complete, holes are sealed with mortar or grout to blend seamlessly into your floor or surface.

## Where It’s Used

- Under concrete slabs and tiled floors  
- Inside wall voids or hollow block walls  
- Around structural footings and posts  
- Beneath kitchen or bathroom flooring
