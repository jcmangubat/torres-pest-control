Our **Termite Abatement Maintenance Program** is designed to provide continuous protection from termite activity through a series of scheduled treatments, inspections, and reinforcements. Think of it as a termite insurance plan—keeping your home or property monitored and protected year-round.

This service is especially ideal for structures in termite-prone areas or those with a history of infestation.

   Our team returns on a regular basis—monthly, quarterly, or semi-annually—depending on your property’s risk level and needs.

3. **Preventive Spot Treatments**  
   We reinforce vulnerable zones like soil, slab edges, wood framing, and utility penetrations.

4. **Documentation & Reporting**  
   You'll receive a treatment log and reports you can use for insurance, audits, or real estate transactions.
