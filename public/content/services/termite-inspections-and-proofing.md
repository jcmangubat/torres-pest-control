## 🔍 What is Termite Inspection & Proofing?

**Termite Inspection** is a thorough examination of your property to look for signs of termite presence, past damage, and vulnerable entry points.  
**Proofing** means strengthening your home against future infestations through physical barriers, sealing cracks, and applying preventive treatments.
