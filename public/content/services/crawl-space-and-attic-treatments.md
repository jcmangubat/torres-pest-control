**Crawl spaces and attics** are often overlooked, yet they’re among the most vulnerable areas for pest infestations—especially termites, rodents, and moisture-loving insects. Our specialized treatment targets these tucked-away zones to stop pests where they hide, nest, and breed.

We clean, treat, and protect these spaces—so you don’t have to worry about what’s lurking overhead or underfoot.

## 🔍 What We Do

1. **Thorough Inspection**  
   We evaluate insulation, wood structures, vents, and gaps for pest activity or signs of damage.

2. **Targeted Application**  
   Using low-odor, long-lasting solutions, we treat critical areas including beams, joists, insulation, and vapor barriers.

3. **Optional Decontamination & Sealing**  
   For heavily infested spaces, we offer deep cleaning, removal of droppings or nests, and sealing of pest entry points.
