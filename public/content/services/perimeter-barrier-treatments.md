# Perimeter Barrier Treatments  
Your property’s first line of defense against termites—silent protectors around your foundation.

Our **Perimeter Barrier Treatment** creates a chemical shield around your home or building, preventing termites from ever reaching the structure. This proven method targets the soil where termites typically travel, forming a protective barrier that lasts for months and repels or eliminates colonies before they can cause damage.

It’s a simple, smart way to protect what’s inside—by guarding what’s outside.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Inspection & Site Mapping**  
   We begin with a thorough assessment to identify at-risk zones along your property perimeter.

2. **Trenching & Drilling**  
   Shallow trenches are created around the building, and where necessary, small holes are drilled through concrete paths or tiles for deeper application.

3. **Chemical Application**  
   A termiticide solution is carefully applied into the soil, creating a continuous underground shield.

4. **Sealing & Restoration**  
   Trenches are backfilled and drilled points are sealed to preserve aesthetics and structural integrity.
